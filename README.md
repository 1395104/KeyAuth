# KeyAuth.py

this project is a combination of a login system with updating passwords and users aswel as a breif shop portion which leads to the main function of the program, the key generation and varification.

it will start by asking the user if they have an account. if the anwser is no it promts the user to make one and updates the array with new information that stays for the session. if the user has an account igt prompts the user for a username and password that is stored in the array. 

once the user is logged in is brings up a shop feature that asks the user to enter a number corrisponding to the item on the list.

now to the main feature which is the key generation and varification. once the key is made it is displayed and a prompt underneath asking the user to re enter the key, if entered correctly the message displayed is positive saying that your order is varifiyed. but if entered wrong it will stop the process and log the user out, making them go through the login and ordering process again.
